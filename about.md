## Research Interests

I am interested in resolving outstanding fundamental scientific problems that impede the computational materials design process. My immediate goal is to develop a more quantitative understanding of materials synthesis-structure relationships; specifically, to elucidate and predict crystallization pathways through metastable phases during materials formation. My work involves developing new thermodynamic frameworks and density functional theory (DFT)-based tools to investigate solid-aqueous phase equilibria at the nanoscale, competitive nucleation, and constrained equilibria. I also use data-mining techniques to design new technological materials, and to map relationships across the structural and thermodynamic landscape of known materials.
