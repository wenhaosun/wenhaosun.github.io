Questions: 

1) Are you okay with computational work, or is there an experimental focus in this program? 
2) For DoD funding, should I target a basic science project, or or should we emphasize potential defense applications?
3) Are you interested only in structural alloys or are functional materials also important? 
4) NSF emphasizes broader impacts. Are there any aspects of these proposals that we should emphasize? 
5) I have 3 project ideas:
HEA discovery and design; in particular heterogeneous dual-phase (or higher phase) HEAs. Using visualizations of the phase stability landscape. 
Liquidus lines for prediction of flux synthesis.
