# Targeted Synthesis

DFT is often used to predict novel materials with exciting properties. However, even when DFT can predict what compounds to make, 
how do we synthesize these newly predicted materials in a lab? Developing a predictive theory of materials synthesis requires a better understanding of metastable phasesâ€”which often appear as kinetic byproducts during materials formation. We derive theoretical frameworks to predict non-equilibrium crystallization pathways, helping chemists to navigate through the thermodynamic and kinetic energy landscape towards the synthesis of novel target materials.
